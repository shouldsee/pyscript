Evolutionary traces of single domains are as important as that of protein itself.
Structures are more conserved than sequences and allow a longer evolutionary trace.
Quantify similarity between protein structures
RMSD-root means squard devisation

Algorithms to compare:
	1.decompose structure into vectorised secondary units, and abstract the relation between vectors into graphs. Then find common maps. Fast to rule out homology but does not include toplogical information.
	2.By contact maps, pairwised distance betweeen residues. Also can be acquired from NMR.
	3. indels and dynamic programming: produce a sequence alignment to seed a structural alignment
Algorithms:
	SSAP, DALI?
	CATH database: hiearchial, effectively a metric between superfamilies

Evolution:Divergent or Convergent?
	rule of thumb: RMSD<4A ,SSAP>80
	distubution of CATH database: 
	80 million sequences
	2738 cath superfamilies. 
		100 SF's include 40mn seqs
		2638 include the rest 40mn.
Common : duplication,mutation,fusion/embelishment,oligomerisation
	The mosaic theory of protein evolution

(Structural-> conservation ->Function) mapping is complex
